# hello-world

Hi!

My name is Andreina and I am just starting off my first quarter for a Software Development program at a local technical college. I have a Bachelors in business & economics and most of my work experience is in the financial services sector. I am very ecstastic to learn how to code different software applications with different programming languages. I am new to coding so please bare with me as I start this new experience!
